# Radio Station Widget - ReactJS - TypeScript

This project implements a simple widget that displays different radio station fetched from an external API. Users will be able to switch between different radio stations. The widget is mostly static and doesn't fetch any audio from actual radio stations. This project is implemented with ReactJS and TypeScript. [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) where used for styling. Simple state management was done using Redux with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/). The app also uses simple animation from the [Frame Motion Library](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

## Assumptions about the APP

1- The App does not fetch actual radio station data or audio.

2- The Icons and buttons on the app are for display only and do not have any functionality yet.
